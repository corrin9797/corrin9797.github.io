    <h1>Techside</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>There are two halves to this world. One is "Mageside", a single expanse of land where magic exists in abundance. The other, "Techside", is an expanse of stars and planets where technology directs the power of the world. Though it's possible to travel from one side to the other via fixed portals on either side, you should exercise caution - the powers of one side will wither in the other. Electronics short out and magic dampens the further you travel from the portal, so you'll need a good reason to venture far from home.</p>
        <p>Still, it's not a hard barrier. Close to the portal, some powers remain active - steam power takes a bit before giving out, and gunpowder remains active throughout about half of Mageside, even making up the backbone of the Sarnish army. Odds are, if you're from Mageside, you won't understand much about the trappings of the technological world, but you'll know they exist, and know a bit about how powerful they can be.</p>
        <p>The first campaign won't take place in Techside, but you might come close to a portal or two, and your characters would have heard of it. If I do another campaign in this universe, it'll probably take place in Techside, feeling the reverberations of your actions in Mageside.</p>
