            <h2>Summary:</h2>
            <img src="laplaceSpider.jpg" alt="Laplace" class="vizier-image">
            <p>Laplace's theory is a simple one: given perfect information, he thinks he can predict the future in its totality. With that power, he will rule the universe from the shadows, with the power to kill a king by knocking a roof tile loose three days before he walks under it. Laplace's theory has merits - his followers can harness his magic to see a few seconds into the future, and Laplace himself masterminds schemes for events years in the future. His power is almost perfect.</p>
            <p>Almost.</p>
            <p>Laplace's one weakness is virtue - his visions of the future cannot comprehend selflessness or sacrifice. Many of his best-laid plans have been foiled at the last second by a simple act of kindness. But then, Laplace doesn't view this as much of a problem. If virtue is the one thing stopping him from ruling the world, there's a simple solution, isn't there? Eradicate every trace of goodwill in the world, and his dominion of it will surely follow.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Powers:</h2>
        <p>- Foresight of the future, usually in small bursts for his less-powerful followers.</p>
        <p>- Abilities centered around traps and snares - with a focus on webs.</p>
        <p>- Strong mental powers, centered around gaining and retaining information.</p>

        <h2>Weaknesses:</h2>
        <p>- Virtue, as noted - his powers only work when everyone involved is selfish.</p>
        <p>- Foresight can't look everywhere at once - if you look at yourself, you'll see someone ambushing you in the future, but not someone sneaking by you.</p>
        <p>- His foresight tends not to work on other viziers, as they encompass too many things to process at once. Still, that's just a hardware problem - if he had more power, he could predict the workings of gods.</p>

        <h2>Followers:</h2>
        <p>- His Kren'la have blueish skin and anywhere from four to six eyes. Some among them can see a second or two into the future.</p>
        <p>- His most devoted followers can ascend, gaining six extra spider-like limbs and greater magical power. Of course, Laplace only lets people ascend when he thinks he can control them...</p>

        <h2>Misconceptions:</h2>
        <p>- Many of the rich and powerful think Laplace to be one of the "agreeable" viziers, because he's willing to negotiate with them. This is foolhardy - if you're the sort of person he doesn't think is worth killing, you're already his pawn.</p>
